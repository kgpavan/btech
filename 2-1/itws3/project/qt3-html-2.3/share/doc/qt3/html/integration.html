<p> The Visual Studio Integration Plugin is currently available only to users of
Visual Studio 6, it offers simple ways of doing common tasks when writing a
Qt application. 
<p> <h2> How to install the Visual Studio Integration Plugin
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> When you install Qt, the integration plugin should be installed for you,
however, sometimes this does  not happen, so to install the integration
plugin manually just carry out the following steps.
<p> <ul>
<li> Close down any instances of Visual Studio.
<li> Bring up a command prompt.
<li> Type 'cd %QTDIR%\tools\designer\integration\qmsdev' in that command prompt.
<li> Type 'nmake' in that command prompt.
<li> Start up Visual Studio.
<li> Select Tools | Customize | Add-ins and Macro Files.
<li> Ensure that there is a tick next to QMsDev Developer Studio Add-In.
<li> Click Close.
</ul>
<p> Now the integration plugin should be installed.  If this did not work for you
then I suggest you contact your friendly Trolltech Support team giving details
of what part went wrong.
<p> <h2> How to uninstall the Visual Studio Integration Plugin
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> When you want to uninstall the integration plugin, just carry out the
following steps.
<p> <ul>
<li> Close down any instances of Visual Studio.
<li> Delete the file '%MSDevDir%\addins\qmsdev.dll'
</ul>
<p> <h2> What can the Visual Studio Integration Plugin do?
</h2>
<a name="3"></a><p> The integration plugin offers a few things that you can do,
they are as follows.
<p> <ul>
<li> New Qt Project
<li> New Qt Dialog
<li> Qt Designer
<li> Open Qt Project
<li> Write Qt Project
<li> Use Qt In Current Project
<li> Add MOC
</ul>
<p> <h2> Using the 'New Qt Project' button
</h2>
<a name="4"></a><p> The 'New Qt Project' button allows you to create a simple Qt project ready
for extending.  All you need to do is fill in the form and if you select
'Dialog' or 'Main Window' without MDI support then it will start up
Qt Designer for you.  When you have finished with the form in Qt Designer
just save it and it will appear in a ready made Qt project for you.
<p> If you select 'Main Window' with 'MDI Support' then it will simply give you
a code skeleton in a project which you will need to populate with your code.
<p> <h2> Using the 'New Qt Dialog' button
</h2>
<a name="5"></a><p> The 'New Qt Dialog' button works in two ways, you can use it to create a new
dialog for your project, or you can  use it to insert an already existing
dialog into your project.
<p> If you want to create a new dialog then all you need to do is specify where
the dialog file should be saved and give it a name.  This will start up
Qt Designer to allow you to edit your newly created dialog and add it to
the existing  project for you.
<p> If you want to add an existing dialog to your project, then just select the
relevant ui file.  This will then add it to your existing project and add
the relevant steps to create the generated code for you.
<p> <h2> Using the 'Qt Designer' button
</h2>
<a name="6"></a><p> The 'Qt Designer' button simply starts up Qt Designer, it has no ties to
your existing project so whatever you do with it will not effect your
existing projects.  It can also be started up by using the Ctrl+Shift+D key
combination in Visual Studio.
<p> <h2> Using the 'Open Qt Project' button
</h2>
<a name="7"></a><p> The 'Open Qt Project' button will allow you to easily convert an existing
qmake project file into a .dsp file which you can insert into your existing
workspace.  When you click the 'Open Qt Project' button, just select an
existing qmake project file (.pro) and then click OK.  You will get a message
box when it has done which tells you to insert the newly created .dsp file
into your existing workspace.
<p> <h2> Using the 'Write Qt Project' button
</h2>
<a name="8"></a><p> The 'Write Qt Project' button will create a qmake project (.pro) file for
your current project so that you can easily copy  the files onto another
platform and be able to use qmake to create a Makefile on that other
platform.  All you need to do is make the project you wish to write a
project for the current project and click on the button.  Just name your
qmake project file and click Save.
<p> <h2> Using the 'Use Qt In Current Project' button
</h2>
<a name="9"></a><p> The 'Use Qt In Current Project' button simply adds in the necessary
information for the current project so that it links against Qt and
sets any other settings needed to use Qt in that project.
<p> <h2> Using the 'Add MOC' button
</h2>
<a name="10"></a><p> The 'Add MOC' button will add in the custom build step for the selected file
so that it creates any needed MOC files and it will  add these generated
files to the project.  All you need to do to use it is click on a file that
has <a href="metaobjects.html#Q_OBJECT">Q_OBJECT</a> and click the button.  
<p> You only need to use this button if you added a file that has Q_OBJECT in
it by hand, you don't need to use this if you used any of the previously
mentioned buttons.  It can also be invoked by using the Ctrl+Shift+M key
combination in Visual Studio.
