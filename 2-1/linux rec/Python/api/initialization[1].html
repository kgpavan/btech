8. Initialization, Finalization, and Threads
         
</H1>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name='l2h-434'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_Initialize</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Initialize the Python interpreter.  In an application embedding 
Python, this should be called before using any other Python/C API 
functions; with the exception of
<tt class="cfunction">Py_SetProgramName()</tt><a name='l2h-473'></a>,
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_InitThreads()</tt><a name='l2h-474'></a>,
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_ReleaseLock()</tt><a name='l2h-475'></a>,
and <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_AcquireLock()</tt><a name='l2h-476'></a>.
This initializes the table of loaded modules (<code>sys.modules</code>), and
<a name='l2h-436'></a>creates the
fundamental modules <tt class="module">__builtin__</tt><a name='l2h-477'></a>,
<tt class="module">__main__</tt><a name='l2h-478'></a> and
<tt class="module">sys</tt><a name='l2h-479'></a>.  It also initializes the module
search<a name='l2h-480'></a> path (<code>sys.path</code>).
It does not set <code>sys.argv</code>; use
<tt class="cfunction">PySys_SetArgv()</tt><a name='l2h-481'></a> for that.  This
is a no-op when called for a second time (without calling
<tt class="cfunction">Py_Finalize()</tt><a name='l2h-482'></a> first).  There is no
return value; it is a fatal error if the initialization fails.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>int <b><a name='l2h-437'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_IsInitialized</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return true (nonzero) when the Python interpreter has been
initialized, false (zero) if not.  After <tt class="cfunction">Py_Finalize()</tt> is
called, this returns false until <tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt> is called
again.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name='l2h-438'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_Finalize</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Undo all initializations made by <tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt> and
subsequent use of Python/C API functions, and destroy all
sub-interpreters (see <tt class="cfunction">Py_NewInterpreter()</tt> below) that were
created and not yet destroyed since the last call to
<tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt>.  Ideally, this frees all memory allocated
by the Python interpreter.  This is a no-op when called for a second
time (without calling <tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt> again first).  There
is no return value; errors during finalization are ignored.

<P>
This function is provided for a number of reasons.  An embedding 
application might want to restart Python without having to restart the 
application itself.  An application that has loaded the Python 
interpreter from a dynamically loadable library (or DLL) might want to 
free all memory allocated by Python before unloading the DLL. During a 
hunt for memory leaks in an application a developer might want to free 
all memory allocated by Python before exiting from the application.

<P>
<b>Bugs and caveats:</b> The destruction of modules and objects in 
modules is done in random order; this may cause destructors 
(<tt class="method">__del__()</tt> methods) to fail when they depend on other objects 
(even functions) or modules.  Dynamically loaded extension modules 
loaded by Python are not unloaded.  Small amounts of memory allocated 
by the Python interpreter may not be freed (if you find a leak, please 
report it).  Memory tied up in circular references between objects is 
not freed.  Some memory allocated by extension modules may not be 
freed.  Some extension may not work properly if their initialization 
routine is called more than once; this can happen if an applcation 
calls <tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt> and <tt class="cfunction">Py_Finalize()</tt> more
than once.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>PyThreadState* <b><a name='l2h-439'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_NewInterpreter</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Create a new sub-interpreter.  This is an (almost) totally separate
environment for the execution of Python code.  In particular, the new
interpreter has separate, independent versions of all imported
modules, including the fundamental modules
<tt class="module">__builtin__</tt><a name='l2h-483'></a>,
<tt class="module">__main__</tt><a name='l2h-484'></a> and
<tt class="module">sys</tt><a name='l2h-485'></a>.  The table of loaded modules
(<code>sys.modules</code>) and the module search path (<code>sys.path</code>) are
also separate.  The new environment has no <code>sys.argv</code> variable.
It has new standard I/O stream file objects <code>sys.stdin</code>,
<code>sys.stdout</code> and <code>sys.stderr</code> (however these refer to the
same underlying <tt class="ctype">FILE</tt> structures in the C library).

  <a name='l2h-441'></a>
<P>
The return value points to the first thread state created in the new 
sub-interpreter.  This thread state is made the current thread state.  
Note that no actual thread is created; see the discussion of thread 
states below.  If creation of the new interpreter is unsuccessful, 
<tt class="constant">NULL</tt> is returned; no exception is set since the exception state 
is stored in the current thread state and there may not be a current 
thread state.  (Like all other Python/C API functions, the global 
interpreter lock must be held before calling this function and is 
still held when it returns; however, unlike most other Python/C API 
functions, there needn't be a current thread state on entry.)

<P>
Extension modules are shared between (sub-)interpreters as follows: 
the first time a particular extension is imported, it is initialized 
normally, and a (shallow) copy of its module's dictionary is 
squirreled away.  When the same extension is imported by another 
(sub-)interpreter, a new module is initialized and filled with the 
contents of this copy; the extension's <code>init</code> function is not
called.  Note that this is different from what happens when an
extension is imported after the interpreter has been completely
re-initialized by calling
<tt class="cfunction">Py_Finalize()</tt><a name='l2h-486'></a> and
<tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt><a name='l2h-487'></a>; in that case,
the extension's <code>init<var>module</var></code> function <i>is</i> called
again.

<P>
<b>Bugs and caveats:</b> Because sub-interpreters (and the main 
interpreter) are part of the same process, the insulation between them 
isn't perfect -- for example, using low-level file operations like 
<a name='l2h-443'></a><tt class="function">os.close()</tt> they can (accidentally or maliciously) affect each 
other's open files.  Because of the way extensions are shared between 
(sub-)interpreters, some extensions may not work properly; this is 
especially likely when the extension makes use of (static) global 
variables, or when the extension manipulates its module's dictionary 
after its initialization.  It is possible to insert objects created in 
one sub-interpreter into a namespace of another sub-interpreter; this 
should be done with great care to avoid sharing user-defined 
functions, methods, instances or classes between sub-interpreters, 
since import operations executed by such objects may affect the 
wrong (sub-)interpreter's dictionary of loaded modules.  (XXX This is 
a hard-to-fix bug that will be addressed in a future release.)
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name='l2h-444'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_EndInterpreter</tt></a></b> (<var>PyThreadState *tstate</var>)
<dd>
Destroy the (sub-)interpreter represented by the given thread state.  
The given thread state must be the current thread state.  See the 
discussion of thread states below.  When the call returns, the current 
thread state is <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>.  All thread states associated with this 
interpreted are destroyed.  (The global interpreter lock must be held 
before calling this function and is still held when it returns.)  
<tt class="cfunction">Py_Finalize()</tt><a name='l2h-488'></a> will destroy all
sub-interpreters that haven't been explicitly destroyed at that point.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name='l2h-445'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_SetProgramName</tt></a></b> (<var>char *name</var>)
<dd>
This function should be called before
<tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt><a name='l2h-489'></a> is called
for the first time, if it is called at all.  It tells the interpreter 
the value of the <code>argv[0]</code> argument to the
<tt class="cfunction">main()</tt><a name='l2h-490'></a> function of the program.  This is
used by <tt class="cfunction">Py_GetPath()</tt><a name='l2h-491'></a> and some other  
functions below to find the Python run-time libraries relative to the 
interpreter executable.  The default value is <code>"python"</code>.  The 
argument should point to a zero-terminated character string in static 
storage whose contents will not change for the duration of the 
program's execution.  No code in the Python interpreter will change 
the contents of this storage.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>char* <b><a name='l2h-446'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetProgramName</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return the program name set with
<tt class="cfunction">Py_SetProgramName()</tt><a name='l2h-492'></a>, or the
default.  The returned string points into static storage; the caller 
should not modify its value.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>char* <b><a name='l2h-447'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetPrefix</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return the <i>prefix</i> for installed platform-independent files.  This 
is derived through a number of complicated rules from the program name 
set with <tt class="cfunction">Py_SetProgramName()</tt> and some environment variables; 
for example, if the program name is <code>"/usr/local/bin/python"</code>, 
the prefix is <code>"/usr/local"</code>.  The returned string points into 
static storage; the caller should not modify its value.  This 
corresponds to the prefix variable in the top-level 
<font class="file" face="sans-serif">Makefile</font> and the <code>-</code><code>-prefix</code> argument to the 
<b class="program">configure</b> script at build time.  The value is available to 
Python code as <code>sys.prefix</code>.  It is only useful on Unix.  See 
also the next function.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>char* <b><a name='l2h-448'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetExecPrefix</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return the <i>exec-prefix</i> for installed platform-<i>de</i>pendent 
files.  This is derived through a number of complicated rules from the 
program name set with <tt class="cfunction">Py_SetProgramName()</tt> and some environment 
variables; for example, if the program name is 
<code>"/usr/local/bin/python"</code>, the exec-prefix is 
<code>"/usr/local"</code>.  The returned string points into static storage; 
the caller should not modify its value.  This corresponds to the 
exec_prefix variable in the top-level <font class="file" face="sans-serif">Makefile</font> and the 
<code>-</code><code>-exec_prefix</code> argument to the <b class="program">configure</b> script
at build  time.  The value is available to Python code as 
<code>sys.exec_prefix</code>.  It is only useful on Unix.

<P>
Background: The exec-prefix differs from the prefix when platform 
dependent files (such as executables and shared libraries) are 
installed in a different directory tree.  In a typical installation, 
platform dependent files may be installed in the 
<code>"/usr/local/plat"</code> subtree while platform independent may be 
installed in <code>"/usr/local"</code>.

<P>
Generally speaking, a platform is a combination of hardware and 
software families, e.g.  Sparc machines running the Solaris 2.x 
operating system are considered the same platform, but Intel machines 
running Solaris 2.x are another platform, and Intel machines running 
Linux are yet another platform.  Different major revisions of the same 
operating system generally also form different platforms.  Non-Unix 
operating systems are a different story; the installation strategies 
on those systems are so different that the prefix and exec-prefix are 
meaningless, and set to the empty string.  Note that compiled Python 
bytecode files are platform independent (but not independent from the 
Python version by which they were compiled!).

<P>
System administrators will know how to configure the <b class="program">mount</b> or 
<b class="program">automount</b> programs to share <code>"/usr/local"</code> between platforms 
while having <code>"/usr/local/plat"</code> be a different filesystem for each 
platform.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>char* <b><a name='l2h-449'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetProgramFullPath</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return the full program name of the Python executable; this is 
computed as a side-effect of deriving the default module search path 
from the program name (set by
<tt class="cfunction">Py_SetProgramName()</tt><a name='l2h-493'></a> above).
The returned string points into static storage; the caller should not 
modify its value.  The value is available to Python code as 
<code>sys.executable</code>.
<a name='l2h-451'></a></dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>char* <b><a name='l2h-452'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetPath</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
<a name='l2h-494'></a>
Return the default module search path; this is computed from the 
program name (set by <tt class="cfunction">Py_SetProgramName()</tt> above) and some 
environment variables.  The returned string consists of a series of 
directory names separated by a platform dependent delimiter character.  
The delimiter character is "<tt class="character">:</tt>" on Unix, "<tt class="character">;</tt>" on
DOS/Windows, and "<tt class="character">&#92;n</tt>" (the ASCII newline character) on
Macintosh.  The returned string points into static storage; the caller
should not modify its value.  The value is available to Python code 
as the list <code>sys.path</code><a name='l2h-454'></a>,
which may be modified to change the future search path for loaded
modules.

<P>
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>const char* <b><a name='l2h-455'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetVersion</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return the version of this Python interpreter.  This is a string that 
looks something like

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
"1.5 (#67, Dec 31 1997, 22:34:28) [GCC 2.7.2.2]"
</pre></dl>

<P>
The first word (up to the first space character) is the current Python 
version; the first three characters are the major and minor version 
separated by a period.  The returned string points into static storage; 
the caller should not modify its value.  The value is available to 
Python code as the list <code>sys.version</code>.
<a name='l2h-457'></a></dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>const char* <b><a name='l2h-458'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetPlatform</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return the platform identifier for the current platform.  On Unix, 
this is formed from the ``official'' name of the operating system, 
converted to lower case, followed by the major revision number; e.g., 
for Solaris 2.x, which is also known as SunOS 5.x, the value is 
<code>"sunos5"</code>.  On Macintosh, it is <code>"mac"</code>.  On Windows, it 
is <code>"win"</code>.  The returned string points into static storage; 
the caller should not modify its value.  The value is available to 
Python code as <code>sys.platform</code>.
<a name='l2h-460'></a></dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>const char* <b><a name='l2h-461'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetCopyright</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return the official copyright string for the current Python version, 
for example

<P>
<code>"Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam"</code>
<P>
The returned string points into static storage; the caller should not 
modify its value.  The value is available to Python code as the list 
<code>sys.copyright</code>.
<a name='l2h-463'></a></dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>const char* <b><a name='l2h-464'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetCompiler</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return an indication of the compiler used to build the current Python 
version, in square brackets, for example:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
"[GCC 2.7.2.2]"
</pre></dl>

<P>
The returned string points into static storage; the caller should not 
modify its value.  The value is available to Python code as part of 
the variable <code>sys.version</code>.
<a name='l2h-466'></a></dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>const char* <b><a name='l2h-467'><tt class='cfunction'>Py_GetBuildInfo</tt></a></b> ()
<dd>
Return information about the sequence number and build date and time 
of the current Python interpreter instance, for example

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
"#67, Aug  1 1997, 22:34:28"
</pre></dl>

<P>
The returned string points into static storage; the caller should not 
modify its value.  The value is available to Python code as part of 
the variable <code>sys.version</code>.
<a name='l2h-469'></a></dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>int <b><a name='l2h-470'><tt class='cfunction'>PySys_SetArgv</tt></a></b> (<var>int argc, char **argv</var>)
<dd>
Set <code>sys.argv</code> based on <var>argc</var> and <var>argv</var>.  These
parameters are similar to those passed to the program's
<tt class="cfunction">main()</tt><a name='l2h-495'></a> function with the difference that
the first entry should refer to the script file to be executed rather
than the executable hosting the Python interpreter.  If there isn't a
script that will be run, the first entry in <var>argv</var> can be an empty
string.  If this function fails to initialize <code>sys.argv</code>, a fatal 
condition is signalled using
<tt class="cfunction">Py_FatalError()</tt><a name='l2h-496'></a>.
<a name='l2h-472'></a></dl>
