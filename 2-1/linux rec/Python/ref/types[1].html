3.2 The standard type hierarchy
</H1>

<P>
Below is a list of the types that are built into Python.  Extension
modules written in C can define additional types.  Future versions of
Python may add types to the type hierarchy (e.g., rational
numbers, efficiently stored arrays of integers, etc.).
<a name='l2h-69'></a>

<P>
Some of the type descriptions below contain a paragraph listing
`special attributes.'  These are attributes that provide access to the
implementation and are not intended for general use.  Their definition
may change in the future.  There are also some `generic' special
attributes, not listed with the individual objects: <tt class="member">__methods__</tt>
is a list of the method names of a built-in object, if it has any;
<tt class="member">__members__</tt> is a list of the data attribute names of a built-in
object, if it has any.
<a name='l2h-70'></a>

  <a name='l2h-32'></a>
<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>None</STRONG>
<DD>This type has a single value.  There is a single object with this value.
This object is accessed through the built-in name <code>None</code>.
It is used to signify the absence of a value in many situations, e.g.,
it is returned from functions that don't explicitly return anything.
Its truth value is false.
<a name='l2h-71'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Ellipsis</STRONG>
<DD>This type has a single value.  There is a single object with this value.
This object is accessed through the built-in name <code>Ellipsis</code>.
It is used to indicate the presence of the "<tt class="samp">...</tt>" syntax in a
slice.  Its truth value is true.
<a name='l2h-72'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Numbers</STRONG>
<DD>These are created by numeric literals and returned as results by
arithmetic operators and arithmetic built-in functions.  Numeric
objects are immutable; once created their value never changes.  Python
numbers are of course strongly related to mathematical numbers, but
subject to the limitations of numerical representation in computers.
<a name='l2h-73'></a>

<P>
Python distinguishes between integers and floating point numbers:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Integers</STRONG>
<DD>These represent elements from the mathematical set of whole numbers.
<a name='l2h-74'></a>
<P>
There are two types of integers:

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>Plain integers</STRONG>
<DD>These represent numbers in the range -2147483648 through 2147483647.
(The range may be larger on machines with a larger natural word
size, but not smaller.)
When the result of an operation would fall outside this range, the
exception <tt class="exception">OverflowError</tt> is raised.
For the purpose of shift and mask operations, integers are assumed to
have a binary, 2's complement notation using 32 or more bits, and
hiding no bits from the user (i.e., all 4294967296 different bit
patterns correspond to different values).
<a name='l2h-75'></a>
<a name='l2h-34'></a>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Long integers</STRONG>
<DD>These represent numbers in an unlimited range, subject to available
(virtual) memory only.  For the purpose of shift and mask operations,
a binary representation is assumed, and negative numbers are
represented in a variant of 2's complement which gives the illusion of
an infinite string of sign bits extending to the left.
<a name='l2h-76'></a>

<P>
</DL> 
<P>
The rules for integer representation are intended to give the most
meaningful interpretation of shift and mask operations involving
negative integers and the least surprises when switching between the
plain and long integer domains.  For any operation except left shift,
if it yields a result in the plain integer domain without causing
overflow, it will yield the same result in the long integer domain or
when using mixed operands.
<a name='l2h-77'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Floating point numbers</STRONG>
<DD>These represent machine-level double precision floating point numbers.  
You are at the mercy of the underlying machine architecture and
C implementation for the accepted range and handling of overflow.
Python does not support single-precision floating point numbers; the
savings in CPU and memory usage that are usually the reason for using
these is dwarfed by the overhead of using objects in Python, so there
is no reason to complicate the language with two kinds of floating
point numbers.
<a name='l2h-78'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Complex numbers</STRONG>
<DD>These represent complex numbers as a pair of machine-level double
precision floating point numbers.  The same caveats apply as for
floating point numbers.  The real and imaginary value of a complex
number <code>z</code> can be retrieved through the attributes <code>z.real</code>and <code>z.imag</code>.
<a name='l2h-79'></a>

<P>
</DL> 
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Sequences</STRONG>
<DD>These represent finite ordered sets indexed by natural numbers.
The built-in function <tt class="function">len()</tt><a name='l2h-80'></a> returns the
number of items of a sequence.
When the lenth of a sequence is <var>n</var>, the
index set contains the numbers 0, 1, ..., <var>n</var>-1.  Item
<var>i</var> of sequence <var>a</var> is selected by <code><var>a</var>[<var>i</var>]</code>.
<a name='l2h-81'></a>

<P>
Sequences also support slicing: <code><var>a</var>[<var>i</var>:<var>j</var>]</code>selects all items with index <var>k</var> such that <var>i</var> <code>&lt;=</code><var>k</var> <code>&lt;</code> <var>j</var>.  When used as an expression, a slice is a
sequence of the same type.  This implies that the index set is
renumbered so that it starts at 0.
<a name='l2h-82'></a>

<P>
Sequences are distinguished according to their mutability:

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>Immutable sequences</STRONG>
<DD>An object of an immutable sequence type cannot change once it is
created.  (If the object contains references to other objects,
these other objects may be mutable and may be changed; however,
the collection of objects directly referenced by an immutable object
cannot change.)
<a name='l2h-83'></a>

<P>
The following types are immutable sequences:

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>Strings</STRONG>
<DD>The items of a string are characters.  There is no separate
character type; a character is represented by a string of one item.
Characters represent (at least) 8-bit bytes.  The built-in
functions <tt class="function">chr()</tt><a name='l2h-84'></a> and
<tt class="function">ord()</tt><a name='l2h-85'></a> convert between characters and
nonnegative integers representing the byte values.  Bytes with the
values 0-127 usually represent the corresponding ASCII values, but
the interpretation of values is up to the program.  The string
data type is also used to represent arrays of bytes, e.g., to hold data
read from a file.
<a name='l2h-86'></a>

<P>
(On systems whose native character set is not ASCII, strings may use
EBCDIC in their internal representation, provided the functions
<tt class="function">chr()</tt> and <tt class="function">ord()</tt> implement a mapping between ASCII and
EBCDIC, and string comparison preserves the ASCII order.
Or perhaps someone can propose a better rule?)
<a name='l2h-87'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Tuples</STRONG>
<DD>The items of a tuple are arbitrary Python objects.
Tuples of two or more items are formed by comma-separated lists
of expressions.  A tuple of one item (a `singleton') can be formed
by affixing a comma to an expression (an expression by itself does
not create a tuple, since parentheses must be usable for grouping of
expressions).  An empty tuple can be formed by an empty pair of
parentheses.
<a name='l2h-88'></a>

<P>
</DL> 
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Mutable sequences</STRONG>
<DD>Mutable sequences can be changed after they are created.  The
subscription and slicing notations can be used as the target of
assignment and <tt class="keyword">del</tt> (delete) statements.
<a name='l2h-89'></a>

<P>
There is currently a single mutable sequence type:

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>Lists</STRONG>
<DD>The items of a list are arbitrary Python objects.  Lists are formed
by placing a comma-separated list of expressions in square brackets.
(Note that there are no special cases needed to form lists of length 0
or 1.)
<a name='l2h-90'></a>

<P>
</DL> 
<P>
The extension module <tt class="module">array</tt><a name='l2h-91'></a> provides an
additional example of a mutable sequence type.

<P>
</DL> 
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Mappings</STRONG>
<DD>These represent finite sets of objects indexed by arbitrary index sets.
The subscript notation <code>a[k]</code> selects the item indexed
by <code>k</code> from the mapping <code>a</code>; this can be used in
expressions and as the target of assignments or <tt class="keyword">del</tt> statements.
The built-in function <tt class="function">len()</tt> returns the number of items
in a mapping.
<a name='l2h-92'></a>

<P>
There is currently a single intrinsic mapping type:

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>Dictionaries</STRONG>
<DD>These<a name='l2h-93'></a> represent finite sets of objects indexed by
nearly arbitrary values.  The only types of values not acceptable as
keys are values containing lists or dictionaries or other mutable
types that are compared by value rather than by object identity, the
reason being that the efficient implementation of dictionaries
requires a key's hash value to remain constant.
Numeric types used for keys obey the normal rules for numeric
comparison: if two numbers compare equal (e.g., <code>1</code> and
<code>1.0</code>) then they can be used interchangeably to index the same
dictionary entry.

<P>
Dictionaries are <a name='l2h-94'></a>mutable; they are created by the
<code>{...}</code> notation (see section <A href="dict.html#dict">5.2.5</A>, ``Dictionary
Displays'').

<P>
The extension modules <tt class="module">dbm</tt><a name='l2h-95'></a>,
<tt class="module">gdbm</tt><a name='l2h-96'></a>, <tt class="module">bsddb</tt><a name='l2h-97'></a>
provide additional examples of mapping types.

<P>
</DL> 
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Callable types</STRONG>
<DD>These<a name='l2h-98'></a> are the types to which the function call
operation (see section <A href="calls.html#calls">5.3.4</A>, ``Calls'') can be applied:
<a name='l2h-99'></a>

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>User-defined functions</STRONG>
<DD>A user-defined function object is created by a function definition
(see section <A href="function.html#function">7.5</A>, ``Function definitions'').  It should be
called with an argument
list containing the same number of items as the function's formal
parameter list.
<a name='l2h-100'></a>

<P>
Special attributes: <tt class="member">func_doc</tt> or <tt class="member">__doc__</tt> is the
function's documentation string, or None if unavailable;
<tt class="member">func_name</tt> or <tt class="member">__name__</tt> is the function's name;
<tt class="member">func_defaults</tt> is a tuple containing default argument values for
those arguments that have defaults, or <code>None</code> if no arguments
have a default value; <tt class="member">func_code</tt> is the code object representing
the compiled function body; <tt class="member">func_globals</tt> is (a reference to)
the dictionary that holds the function's global variables -- it
defines the global namespace of the module in which the function was
defined.
Of these, <tt class="member">func_code</tt>, <tt class="member">func_defaults</tt> and
<tt class="member">func_doc</tt> (and this <tt class="member">__doc__</tt>) may be writable; the
others can never be changed.
Additional information about a function's definition can be
retrieved from its code object; see the description of internal types
below.

  <a name='l2h-36'></a><a name='l2h-101'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>User-defined methods</STRONG>
<DD>A user-defined method object combines a class, a class instance (or
<code>None</code>) and a user-defined function.
<a name='l2h-102'></a>

<P>
Special read-only attributes: <tt class="member">im_self</tt> is the class instance
object, <tt class="member">im_func</tt> is the function object;
<tt class="member">im_class</tt> is the class that defined the method (which may be a
base class of the class of which <tt class="member">im_self</tt> is an instance);
<tt class="member">__doc__</tt> is the method's documentation (same as
<code>im_func.__doc__</code>); <tt class="member">__name__</tt> is the method name (same as
<code>im_func.__name__</code>).

  <a name='l2h-38'></a>
<P>
User-defined method objects are created in two ways: when getting an
attribute of a class that is a user-defined function object, or when
getting an attributes of a class instance that is a user-defined
function object.  In the former case (class attribute), the
<tt class="member">im_self</tt> attribute is <code>None</code>, and the method object is said
to be unbound; in the latter case (instance attribute), <tt class="method">im_self</tt>
is the instance, and the method object is said to be bound.  For
instance, when <tt class="class">C</tt> is a class which contains a definition for a
function <tt class="method">f()</tt>, <code>C.f</code> does not yield the function object
<code>f</code>; rather, it yields an unbound method object <code>m</code> where
<code>m.im_class</code> is <tt class="class">C</tt>, <code>m.im_func</code> is <tt class="method">f()</tt>, and
<code>m.im_self</code> is <code>None</code>.  When <code>x</code> is a <tt class="class">C</tt>
instance, <code>x.f</code> yields a bound method object <code>m</code> where
<code>m.im_class</code> is <code>C</code>, <code>m.im_func</code> is <tt class="method">f()</tt>, and
<code>m.im_self</code> is <code>x</code>.

  <a name='l2h-40'></a>
<P>
When an unbound user-defined method object is called, the underlying
function (<tt class="member">im_func</tt>) is called, with the restriction that the
first argument must be an instance of the proper class
(<tt class="member">im_class</tt>) or of a derived class thereof.

<P>
When a bound user-defined method object is called, the underlying
function (<tt class="member">im_func</tt>) is called, inserting the class instance
(<tt class="member">im_self</tt>) in front of the argument list.  For instance, when
<tt class="class">C</tt> is a class which contains a definition for a function
<tt class="method">f()</tt>, and <code>x</code> is an instance of <tt class="class">C</tt>, calling
<code>x.f(1)</code> is equivalent to calling <code>C.f(x, 1)</code>.

<P>
Note that the transformation from function object to (unbound or
bound) method object happens each time the attribute is retrieved from
the class or instance.  In some cases, a fruitful optimization is to
assign the attribute to a local variable and call that local variable.
Also notice that this transformation only happens for user-defined
functions; other callable objects (and all non-callable objects) are
retrieved without transformation.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Built-in functions</STRONG>
<DD>A built-in function object is a wrapper around a C function.  Examples
of built-in functions are <tt class="function">len()</tt> and <tt class="function">math.sin()</tt>
(<tt class="module">math</tt> is a standard built-in module).
The number and type of the arguments are
determined by the C function.
Special read-only attributes: <tt class="member">__doc__</tt> is the function's
documentation string, or <code>None</code> if unavailable; <tt class="member">__name__</tt>
is the function's name; <tt class="member">__self__</tt> is set to <code>None</code> (but see
the next item).
<a name='l2h-103'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Built-in methods</STRONG>
<DD>This is really a different disguise of a built-in function, this time
containing an object passed to the C function as an implicit extra
argument.  An example of a built-in method is
<code><var>list</var>.append()</code>, assuming
<var>list</var> is a list object.
In this case, the special read-only attribute <tt class="member">__self__</tt> is set
to the object denoted by <code>list</code>.
<a name='l2h-104'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Classes</STRONG>
<DD>Class objects are described below.  When a class object is called,
a new class instance (also described below) is created and
returned.  This implies a call to the class's <tt class="method">__init__()</tt> method
if it has one.  Any arguments are passed on to the <tt class="method">__init__()</tt>
method.  If there is no <tt class="method">__init__()</tt> method, the class must be called
without arguments.
<a name='l2h-42'></a><a name='l2h-105'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Class instances</STRONG>
<DD>Class instances are described below.  Class instances are callable
only when the class has a <tt class="method">__call__()</tt> method; <code>x(arguments)</code>is a shorthand for <code>x.__call__(arguments)</code>.

<P>
</DL>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Modules</STRONG>
<DD>Modules are imported by the <tt class="keyword">import</tt> statement (see section
<A href="import.html#import">6.11</A>, ``The <tt class="keyword">import</tt> statement'').
A module object has a namespace implemented by a dictionary object
(this is the dictionary referenced by the func_globals attribute of
functions defined in the module).  Attribute references are translated
to lookups in this dictionary, e.g., <code>m.x</code> is equivalent to
<code>m.__dict__["x"]</code>.
A module object does not contain the code object used to
initialize the module (since it isn't needed once the initialization
is done).
<a name='l2h-106'></a>

<P>
Attribute assignment updates the module's namespace dictionary,
e.g., "<tt class="samp">m.x = 1</tt>" is equivalent to "<tt class="samp">m.__dict__["x"] = 1</tt>".

<P>
Special read-only attribute: <tt class="member">__dict__</tt> is the module's
namespace as a dictionary object.
<a name='l2h-44'></a>
<P>
Predefined (writable) attributes: <tt class="member">__name__</tt>
is the module's name; <tt class="member">__doc__</tt> is the
module's documentation string, or
<code>None</code> if unavailable; <tt class="member">__file__</tt> is the pathname of the
file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file.
The <tt class="member">__file__</tt> attribute is not present for C modules that are
statically linked into the interpreter; for extension modules loaded
dynamically from a shared library, it is the pathname of the shared
library file.

  <a name='l2h-46'></a><a name='l2h-107'></a>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Classes</STRONG>
<DD>Class objects are created by class definitions (see section
<A href="class.html#class">7.6</A>, ``Class definitions'').
A class has a namespace implemented by a dictionary object.
Class attribute references are translated to
lookups in this dictionary,
e.g., "<tt class="samp">C.x</tt>" is translated to "<tt class="samp">C.__dict__["x"]</tt>".
When the attribute name is not found
there, the attribute search continues in the base classes.  The search
is depth-first, left-to-right in the order of occurrence in the
base class list.
When a class attribute reference would yield a user-defined function
object, it is transformed into an unbound user-defined method object
(see above).  The <tt class="member">im_class</tt> attribute of this method object is the
class in which the function object was found, not necessarily the
class for which the attribute reference was initiated.
<a name='l2h-108'></a>

<P>
Class attribute assignments update the class's dictionary, never the
dictionary of a base class.
<a name='l2h-109'></a>

<P>
A class object can be called (see above) to yield a class instance (see
below).
<a name='l2h-110'></a>

<P>
Special attributes: <tt class="member">__name__</tt> is the class name;
<tt class="member">__module__</tt> is the module name in which the class was defined;
<tt class="member">__dict__</tt> is the dictionary containing the class's namespace;
<tt class="member">__bases__</tt> is a tuple (possibly empty or a singleton)
containing the base classes, in the order of their occurrence in the
base class list; <tt class="member">__doc__</tt> is the class's documentation string,
or None if undefined.

  <a name='l2h-48'></a>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Class instances</STRONG>
<DD>A class instance is created by calling a class object (see above).
A class instance has a namespace implemented as a dictionary which
is the first place in which
attribute references are searched.  When an attribute is not found
there, and the instance's class has an attribute by that name,
the search continues with the class attributes.  If a class attribute
is found that is a user-defined function object (and in no other
case), it is transformed into an unbound user-defined method object
(see above).  The <tt class="member">im_class</tt> attribute of this method object is
the class in which the function object was found, not necessarily the
class of the instance for which the attribute reference was initiated.
If no class attribute is found, and the object's class has a
<tt class="method">__getattr__()</tt> method, that is called to satisfy the lookup.
<a name='l2h-111'></a>

<P>
Attribute assignments and deletions update the instance's dictionary,
never a class's dictionary.  If the class has a <tt class="method">__setattr__()</tt> or
<tt class="method">__delattr__()</tt> method, this is called instead of updating the
instance dictionary directly.
<a name='l2h-112'></a>

<P>
Class instances can pretend to be numbers, sequences, or mappings if
they have methods with certain special names.  See
section <A href="specialnames.html#specialnames">3.3</A>, ``Special method names.''
<a name='l2h-113'></a>

<P>
Special attributes: <tt class="member">__dict__</tt> is the attribute
dictionary; <tt class="member">__class__</tt> is the instance's class.

  <a name='l2h-50'></a>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Files</STRONG>
<DD>A file object represents an open file.  File objects are created by the
<tt class="function">open()</tt> built-in function, and also by
<tt class="function">os.popen()</tt>, <tt class="function">os.fdopen()</tt>, and the
<tt class="method">makefile()</tt> method of socket objects (and perhaps by other
functions or methods provided by extension modules).  The objects
<code>sys.stdin</code>, <code>sys.stdout</code> and <code>sys.stderr</code> are
initialized to file objects corresponding to the interpreter's
standard input, output and error streams.  See the <i>Python
Library Reference</i> for complete documentation of file objects.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Internal types</STRONG>
<DD>A few types used internally by the interpreter are exposed to the user.
Their definitions may change with future versions of the interpreter,
but they are mentioned here for completeness.
<a name='l2h-116'></a>

<P>
<DL>
<DD><P>
<DT><STRONG>Code objects</STRONG>
<DD>Code objects represent <i>byte-compiled</i> executable Python code, or 
<i>bytecode</i>.
The difference between a code
object and a function object is that the function object contains an
explicit reference to the function's globals (the module in which it
was defined), while a code object contains no context; 
also the default argument values are stored in the function object,
not in the code object (because they represent values calculated at
run-time).  Unlike function objects, code objects are immutable and
contain no references (directly or indirectly) to mutable objects.
<a name='l2h-117'></a>

<P>
Special read-only attributes: <tt class="member">co_name</tt> gives the function
name; <tt class="member">co_argcount</tt> is the number of positional arguments
(including arguments with default values); <tt class="member">co_nlocals</tt> is the
number of local variables used by the function (including arguments);
<tt class="member">co_varnames</tt> is a tuple containing the names of the local
variables (starting with the argument names); <tt class="member">co_code</tt> is a
string representing the sequence of bytecode instructions;
<tt class="member">co_consts</tt> is a tuple containing the literals used by the
bytecode; <tt class="member">co_names</tt> is a tuple containing the names used by
the bytecode; <tt class="member">co_filename</tt> is the filename from which the code
was compiled; <tt class="member">co_firstlineno</tt> is the first line number of the
function; <tt class="member">co_lnotab</tt> is a string encoding the mapping from
byte code offsets to line numbers (for detais see the source code of
the interpreter); <tt class="member">co_stacksize</tt> is the required stack size
(including local variables); <tt class="member">co_flags</tt> is an integer encoding
a number of flags for the interpreter.

  <a name='l2h-58'></a>
<P>
The following flag bits are defined for <tt class="member">co_flags</tt>: bit
<code>0x04</code> is set if the function uses the "<tt class="samp">*arguments</tt>" syntax
to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments; bit
<code>0x08</code> is set if the function uses the "<tt class="samp">**keywords</tt>" syntax
to accept arbitrary keyword arguments; other bits are used internally
or reserved for future use.  If<a name='l2h-118'></a> a code
object represents a function, the first item in <tt class="member">co_consts</tt> is
the documentation string of the function, or <code>None</code> if undefined.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Frame objects</STRONG>
<DD>Frame objects represent execution frames.  They may occur in traceback
objects (see below).
<a name='l2h-119'></a>

<P>
Special read-only attributes: <tt class="member">f_back</tt> is to the previous
stack frame (towards the caller), or <code>None</code> if this is the bottom
stack frame; <tt class="member">f_code</tt> is the code object being executed in this
frame; <tt class="member">f_locals</tt> is the dictionary used to look up local
variables; <tt class="member">f_globals</tt> is used for global variables;
<tt class="member">f_builtins</tt> is used for built-in (intrinsic) names;
<tt class="member">f_restricted</tt> is a flag indicating whether the function is
executing in restricted execution mode;
<tt class="member">f_lineno</tt> gives the line number and <tt class="member">f_lasti</tt> gives the
precise instruction (this is an index into the bytecode string of
the code object).

  <a name='l2h-60'></a>
<P>
Special writable attributes: <tt class="member">f_trace</tt>, if not <code>None</code>, is a
function called at the start of each source code line (this is used by
the debugger); <tt class="member">f_exc_type</tt>, <tt class="member">f_exc_value</tt>,
<tt class="member">f_exc_traceback</tt> represent the most recent exception caught in
this frame.

  <a name='l2h-62'></a>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Traceback objects</STRONG>
<DD>Traceback objects represent a stack trace of an exception.  A
traceback object is created when an exception occurs.  When the search
for an exception handler unwinds the execution stack, at each unwound
level a traceback object is inserted in front of the current
traceback.  When an exception handler is entered, the stack trace is
made available to the program.
(See section <A href="try.html#try">7.4</A>, ``The <code>try</code> statement.'')
It is accessible as <code>sys.exc_traceback</code>, and also as the third
item of the tuple returned by <code>sys.exc_info()</code>.  The latter is
the preferred interface, since it works correctly when the program is
using multiple threads.
When the program contains no suitable handler, the stack trace is written
(nicely formatted) to the standard error stream; if the interpreter is
interactive, it is also made available to the user as
<code>sys.last_traceback</code>.

  <a name='l2h-64'></a><a name='l2h-121'></a>

<P>
Special read-only attributes: <tt class="member">tb_next</tt> is the next level in the
stack trace (towards the frame where the exception occurred), or
<code>None</code> if there is no next level; <tt class="member">tb_frame</tt> points to the
execution frame of the current level; <tt class="member">tb_lineno</tt> gives the line
number where the exception occurred; <tt class="member">tb_lasti</tt> indicates the
precise instruction.  The line number and last instruction in the
traceback may differ from the line number of its frame object if the
exception occurred in a <tt class="keyword">try</tt> statement with no matching
except clause or with a finally clause.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Slice objects</STRONG>
<DD>Slice objects are used to represent slices when <i>extended slice
syntax</i> is used.  This is a slice using two colons, or multiple slices
or ellipses separated by commas, e.g., <code>a[i:j:step]</code>, <code>a[i:j,
k:l]</code>, or <code>a[..., i:j])</code>.  They are also created by the built-in
<tt class="function">slice()</tt><a name='l2h-123'></a> function.

<P>
Special read-only attributes: <tt class="member">start</tt> is the lowerbound;
<tt class="member">stop</tt> is the upperbound; <tt class="member">step</tt> is the step value; each is
<code>None</code> if omitted. These attributes can have any type.
