Write a program to mimick the behaviour of ``ls'' command. ls comes as a part
of GNU Coreutils <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>. Use system calls for
directory and other file-system manipulations.

Your ``ls'' should support the following GNU ``ls'' options.

"-a"	: do not hide entries starting with .
"-b"	: print octal escapes for nongraphic characters
"-l"	: use a long listing format
"-R"	: list subdirectories recursively
"-t"	: sort by modification time

You can implement as many options as you want. Above 5 are mandatory.

``ls'' has a very unique behaviour. When the standard output is a terminal, ``ls'' output
is adjusted according to the size of the screen. The output is in multiple columns (normal
behaviour). But when the standard output is not a terminal, ``ls'' by default assumes "-1"
argument i.e., the contents are printed one per line. Additionally, you may implement this
feature also.

Note: See the documentation for getopt, scandir, stat.
