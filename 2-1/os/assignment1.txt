Given a file name as argument, your program should reverse the contents of the file.
For example, if the contents of a file are 'abc', the contents of output should be 'cba'.


INPUT: The name of input file given as argument to the program

OUTPUT: The contents of input file reversed. The name of output file should be
"reverse_" appended to name of the input file. So, if your input file is called
"input.txt", the output should be in "reverse_input.txt".

You should use system calls to achieve this. See the man pages of open(2), read(2), write(2), 
close(2) and lseek(2). Please don't use file-handling functions like fopen and fseek.

open(2) means that the man page of ``open'' is in section 2 of man pages. So "man 2 open" brings
up the required man page. 



TESTING CORRECTNESS OF OUTPUT: Please go through the man page of ``diff'' command.
If an input file is reversed twice, the output should be the original input file.
So, the contents of "input.txt" and "reverse_reverse_input.txt" should be
identical and this will be checked with diff command.


GENERAL GUIDELINES: Indent the code properly. Comment the code properly.
Your name and roll number should be included as comments.


NOTE: Section 2 of man pages contain help for system calls. If a function's man page is found in
section 2, then the function is a system call.(for eg man 2 read)
