Hi,
Attached is the Demo versio of OSP2 toolkit and also the first 
coding assignment. Please find a document on system calls attached 
as well. Deadline for submission of both the assignments is Tue 
19th August 11:59pm.
For running the OSP2 toolkit you need to have jdk1.5 or higher 
version installed. For jdk versions < 1.5 it will give some errors.(Sorry 
for the confusion in the class).
The zip file contains a directory OSP2 which has a jar file 
Demo.jar and a directory Misc which contains some sample parameter files. 
You can load these parameter files using the load parameter option in the 
gui. You should play around with the toolkit and try for many more 
parameters. We are expecting you to give a ONE PAGE WRITEUP on your 
understanding of the toolkit i.e the analysis of changing different 
parameters, functionality of toolkit etc.
To run the toolkit type the following command in OSP2 dir
'path' represents the path to the bin dir of jdk installed(1.5 or higher)

path/java -classpath .:Demo.jar osp.OSP (on linux)
path/java -classpath .;Demo.jar osp.OSP (on windows){Please note the 
difference in : and ;)

The book explaining the OSP2 toolkit can be downloaded from the following 
link.
