                    HA (ngrams -- computing counts)   (Due: 1 week,
                                                       7 Dec. 6 pm)

1. Randomly select a text of about 5000 words from the internet.

2. Ignore all punctuation marks except sentence boundary. ().
   (a) Prepare a unigram count table. Compute % of coverage, and 
       probabilities of each unigram. Find the number of types and 
       tokens.
   (b) Prepare a bigram count table and bigram probability table. Compute
       unigram counts from the bigram count table and verify 
       that the counts are same as in (a)

3. Select 5 sentences (of length 6- 10 words) at random from the internet.
   (Do not select from the same text used for computing the matrices.)
   For all the selected sentences S,

   Find P(S) using (a) Unigram counts.
                   (b) Bigram counts.

   (Hint: If you are using matrix representation, use sparse representation
   otherwise you would run out of memory!)
