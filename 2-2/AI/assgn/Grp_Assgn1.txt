	HMM TRAINING AND TESTING FOR POS TAGGING
					(Due 1 week , 14th Dec)

Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or POS) is the process of marking up each word in a text with a corresponding
part of speech like noun, verb, adjective ,adverb etc ... , based both on its definition, as well as its context.
The number of part of speech tags in a tagger may vary depending on the information one wants to capture.
For example, in the sentence below, the POS tags are appended at the end of each word with an "_".

He_PRP plays_VBZ Shiva_NNP in_IN the_DT next_JJ play_NN 

In the above sentence, notice the pos tag of the word 'play' in the second position and the last position.
The 'plays' in the second position is a verb and not a plural noun whereas the 'play' at the last position 
is a singular noun and not a simple present verb. This disambiguation is useful in natural language applications.

The task for HA-1 is to build a POS tagger by training HMMs on the given annotated data. You can use TnT tool
for training HMMs. 

The annotated training data has two columns separated by a tab. The first column contains the word and the second column contains
the POS tag. Each word and its POS tag in a sentence is in a new line. A blank line indicates the end of a sentence.

Ex:-
