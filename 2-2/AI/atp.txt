Assignment 1 (Deadline - Friday, 23rd Jan, 5:00pm):

Code an automatic theorem prover for propositional logic using resolution.

Input:

Input from stdin has syntax: LHS => RHS
Both LHS and RHS are well formed propositional logic formulae:

1. English letters stand for basic propositions.
2. Letters may be joined using connectives: ~ (not), ^ (and), | (or), -> (conditional), <-> (biconditional)
3. Brackets may be used for grouping.
4. If brackets are omitted, precedence is used. Precedence order is as above.

Output: 1 (for Valid) or 0 (for not Valid).

Your code will have 4 modules:

1. A module to parse well formed formulae into internal data structures.
2. A module to convert a formula into CNF.
3. A module to apply resolution on a given set of clauses.
4. A module that takes input and uses above modules to give output.

You may use any programming language other than LISP, Prolog and similar AI languages.
